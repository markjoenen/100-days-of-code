# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 10, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Installed Java, studied the java basics and upto methods. Worked on activities that enhanced my knowledge on methods.

**Thoughts:** The installation of Java gave me a little bit of a headache yesterday. So today is when I actually did some work. Worked on methods that I found really hard to grasp before, somehow it's smooth sailing today. Btw, I place the activities in the pomodora repo. Just delete it once we are working on pomo app.
