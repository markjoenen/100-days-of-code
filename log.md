# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 10, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Installed Java, studied the java basics and upto methods. Worked on activities that enhanced my knowledge on methods.

**Thoughts:** The installation of Java gave me a little bit of a headache yesterday. So today is when I actually did some work. Worked on methods that I found really hard to grasp before, somehow it's smooth sailing today. Btw, I place the activities in the pomodora repo. Just delete it once we are working on pomo app.

### Day 1: November 11, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Studied more on objects and learned more on how to properly call methods, fields, what's the purpose of constructor and how to call one to instatiate an object. Learned also the difference in public, private, static, encapsulation of data. It's a short but productive study session.

**Thoughts:** I was troubled understanding what's "this" is used for but today I finally got what it actually does. Methods is confusing and more so when the topic of static are introduced. I need more practice but I'm slowly getting how to use each of the syntaxes. I was a little excited when the topic is about "overloading methods", it was something that I was looking for so finding it is really exciting for me. 8/10 session.
