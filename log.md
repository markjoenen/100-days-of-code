# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 10, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Installed Java, studied the java basics and upto methods. Worked on activities that enhanced my knowledge on methods.

**Thoughts:** The installation of Java gave me a little bit of a headache yesterday. So today is when I actually did some work. Worked on methods that I found really hard to grasp before, somehow it's smooth sailing today. Btw, I place the activities in the pomodora repo. Just delete it once we are working on pomo app.

### Day 1: November 11, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Studied more on objects and learned more on how to properly call methods, fields, what's the purpose of constructor and how to call one to instatiate an object. Learned also the difference in public, private, static, encapsulation of data. It's a short but productive study session.

**Thoughts:** I was troubled understanding what's "this" is used for but today I finally got what it actually does. Methods is confusing and more so when the topic of static are introduced. I need more practice but I'm slowly getting how to use each of the syntaxes. I was a little excited when the topic is about "overloading methods", it was something that I was looking for so finding it is really exciting for me. 8/10 session.

### Day 2: November 12, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Stepped back a little bit from Ojects and studied other data types. One of the topics are about searching methods. Javadocs. Learned about constant variable. Studied about the enhanced loops. Looking forward to these as well!

**Thoughts:** The session today concludes much earlier than I have expected. Studied a little bit about Data Types & Wrapper. I got a little busy. 6/10.

### Day 3: November 13, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Worked on chapter 8 and learned about data types and wrappers for each type. 

**Thoughts:** It is so hard for me to wrap my head around the OBB, I keep forgetting the difference of static costructor, fields, public and private. I might need to revisit previous chapters again to ensure that I'm correctly understanding these. I'm not sure maybe it's the tiredness from today's run but I don't want that to be an excuse. 7/10.
